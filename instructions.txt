Bot should be workable out the box, nothing special. 
- Run "python3 .\muhammad_ali_faq_bot.py" to run the FAQ Bot in the shell 
- Run "python 3 .\simple_discord_faq_bot.py" to make the bot work on Discord (have it online). 

A lot of the answers I wrote myself, so would be cool if you tested some of them out; I feel like some of the answers are fairly informative and interesting. :)
